# Homework Six

This week, we created our very first Vue assignment. We were to display our knowledge of the basic concepts, as well as taking a more advanced approach.

For this assignment, because we had to different components that we needed to fill out, I decided to make two separate components, each with their own JavaScript page, in order to organize everything accordingly.
